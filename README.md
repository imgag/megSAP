# *megSAP* - Medical Genetics Sequence Analysis Pipelines

megSAP is a NGS data analysis pipeline for medical genetics, which is developed by the [Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University Hospital, TÃ¼bingen](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/Klinische_Genetik/start.html) and several collaborators from academia and industry.

The design goals of the project are:

 * state-of-the-art in terms of sensitivity/specificity,
 * fast
 * and usable for diagnostics:
 	* we use no tools that require a license for diagnostics
    * extensive logging (tools, versions, parameters) ensures reproducability of results
	* extensive testing before adding/updating tools or databases makes sure the results are valid

If you are interested to join the effort, please contact [Marc Sturm](https://github.com/marc-sturm).

## Installation

General remarks:
- Only GRCh38 is supported.
- The installation of megSAP is quite time-consuming because large databases for annotation of variants need to be downloaded and converted.

The default way of using megSAP is cloning the megSAP repository and calling the analysis pipelines from there.
Installation instructions for this way can be found [here](doc/install_unix.md).  

**megSAP in container - THIS IS BETA!!!**
  
Alternatively, there is a version of the megSAP pipeline in a container.  
You still need to download databases and tool containers, but the container version may be more convenient in some scenarios like AWS.  
The installation instructions for the container version of megSAP can be found [here](doc/install_unix_container_version.md).
