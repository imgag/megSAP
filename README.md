# *megSAP* - a Medical Genetics Sequence Analysis Pipeline

megSAP is a NGS data analysis pipeline for medical genetics, which is developed by the [Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University Hospital, TÃ¼bingen](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/Klinische_Genetik/start.html) and several collaborators from academia and industry.

The design goals of the project are:

 * state-of-the-art in terms of sensitivity/specificity,
 * fast
 * and usable for diagnostics:
 	* we use no tools that require a license for diagnostics
    * extensive logging (tools, versions, parameters) ensures reproducability of results
	* extensive testing before adding/updating tools or databases makes sure the results are valid

If you are interested to join the effort, please contact [Marc Sturm](https://github.com/marc-sturm).

## Obtaining megSAP

The installation of megSAP is quite time-consuming because many tools and big databases need to installed.  
The installation instructions can be found [here](doc/install_unix.md).

*Note: Only GRCh38 is supported. There is a [branch](https://github.com/imgag/megSAP/tree/GRCh37) for GRCh37, but is is not updated or maintained since December 2021 anymore.*
