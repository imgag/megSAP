# *megSAP* - a Medical Genetics Sequence Analysis Pipeline

The goal of the megSAP proejct is to develop an NGS data analysis pipeline for medical genetics, that is

 * state-of-the-art in terms of performance,
 * fast
 * and usable for diagnostics:
 	* we use no tools that require a license for diagnostics e.g. [GATK](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/)
    * extensive logging (tools, versions, parameters) ensures reproducability of results
	* extensive testing before adding/updating tools or databases makes sure the results are valid

megSAP is developed by the [Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics](http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/Klinische_Genetik/start.html) and several collaborators from academia and industry. If you are interested to join the effort, please contact [Marc Sturm](https://github.com/marc-sturm).

## Download

There are no releases yet.  
Please use git to download the most recent development version:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/megSAP.git

### Resolving proxy issues with git

If you are behind a proxy that block the standard git port, you see something like this:

    $ git clone --recursive https://github.com/imgag/megSAP.git
    Cloning into 'megSAP'...
    fatal: Unable to look up github.com (port 9418) (Name or service not known)

Then you have to adapt your ~/.gitconfig file like that:

    [http]
    proxy = http://[user]:[password]@[host]:[port]

## Dependencies

megSAP (or one of the used tools) depends mainly on the following software to be installed:

* _g++_ (4.5 or higher)
* _qmake_ (Qt 5.5 or higher, including xmlpatterns and mysql package)
* _git_
* _cmake_
* _python_ (including matplotlib)
* _php_
* _tabix_
* _java_ 

For example, the installation of the dependencies using Ubuntu 16.04 looks like that:

	> sudo apt-get install -y wget bzip2 unzip make g++ git cmake tabix build-essential qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev libqt5sql5-mysql libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev php7.0-cli php7.0-xml php7.0-mysql python python-matplotlib libncurses5-dev bzip2 libbz2-dev liblzma-dev default-java

## Initial setup

First, we need to download the tools the pipeline relies on:

	> cd megSAP/data/
	> chmod 755 download_*.sh
	> ./download_tools.sh

Next, we need to download and index the reference genome:
	
	> ./download_GRCh37.sh


Finally, we need to download and convert some open-source databases for annotations:

	> ./download_dbs.sh

**Note:** OMIM, HGMD and COSMIC are not downloaded automatically because of license issues. If you have the license for those databases, download/convert them according to the commented sections in the download script.
